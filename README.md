# CrossyRoad

Developed with Unreal Engine 4
Final Project, Crossy Road, due Sunday, 19 May 2019 (by 2355)
In this assignment, you will recreate the classic Crossy Road game, using the Unreal 4 Engine, assets
created using a Voxel editor such as MagicaVoxel, and code written either in C++ (written to interface with
Blueprints and the Unreal framework), or with Blueprints, or both.
 The 3d assets you will need will all have to be created using an Voxel editor such as MagicaVoxel, or from
other 3d asset sources from Unreal. The audio resources you will need can be captured using an audio
editor such as Audacity from Crossy Road running on a laptop or desktop computer, or running as an iOS
or Google app on a mobile phone.
